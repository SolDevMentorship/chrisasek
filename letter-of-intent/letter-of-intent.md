**Tsara – Letter of Intent (LOI)**

### II. Project Overview

**Capstone Project Name/Idea:**  
Tsara – Unified Stablecoin & Fiat Finance for Africa

**Brief Project Description:**  
Tsara is a digital finance platform that merges the power of stablecoins and fiat to deliver seamless, reliable, and accessible payment, saving, and settlement solutions for African individuals and businesses. By combining onchain money (stablecoins) with local bank rails, Tsara eliminates the disconnect between crypto and fiat, offering businesses and consumers a unified financial experience. Tsara’s tools allow users to collect payments, settle funds, and save in either fiat or stablecoin — choosing what works best for them without friction.

**Reason for Choosing this Project:**  
Today, stablecoins offer better value and stability, but the financial experience in Africa remains fragmented, with fiat and crypto operating in disjointed silos. Tsara aims to solve this by creating a merged ecosystem where crypto and fiat coexist smoothly. Our mission is to make everyday finance — from payments to settlements to savings — crypto-compatible and future-ready for African businesses and consumers.

- **Investors & Ecosystem Partners**: Stakeholders looking for bridges between stablecoins and African fiat markets.

**Value Proposition:**

# Day 1 – Superteam Web3 Dev Mentorship

**Date:** 7th April, 2025

## 🔥 What I Did

- Attended the first mentorship session (Introduction to Web3 for Web2 Developers).
- Read and reflected on this article:  
  👉 [Web3 Explained for Web2 Developers – by Daniel](https://danielandblockchain.hashnode.dev/web3-explained-for-web2-developers-my-personal-journey-from-sql-to-solana)
- Created a public GitHub repository for the mentorship journey.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Web3 is not just a new tech stack — it’s a different paradigm:
  - Web2 = “I talk to my server”
  - Web3 = “I talk to the blockchain”
- Decentralization introduces concepts like immutability, transparency, and trustless systems.
- Solana offers a performant layer-1 chain that’s developer-friendly with Rust.
